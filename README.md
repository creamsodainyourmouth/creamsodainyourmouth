ðŸ‘€ Hi, I am @creamsodainyourmouth
I am interested in web development. Mostly â€“ backend part like develop system,
that are based on interaction between users â€“ these can be various communication tools:
messaging services, forums and chats.
Can use PHP(Yii), Python(Flask, Django) and JavaScript (Vue).

I am also interested in social media analysis: most of all â€“ natural language processing, text classification,
want to study this direction, implement machine learning algorithms in web projects.

At now i'm learning Linux server administration, deploying, programming patterns,
Docker and NoSQL databases.
